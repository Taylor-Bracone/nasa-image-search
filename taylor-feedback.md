## Review of D3 from D1 Standpoint

**1. What parts worked well or that you found the approach novel and should be incorporated into the final solution for your team.**
    
    What worked well was the way that it was structured.
    
**2. What parts could be improved upon. "Nothing it looks great" is not a valid sentiment. Could they provide better commenting / documentation? Are there functions that can be deleted bc the code is unused? Are they monsters and used 4 spaces instead of 2? There's always something either stylistically, documentation or in control logic we can learn from to improve.**
    When lighthouse was ran it onyl showed 88 percent accessibility.
    
**3. Next steps: What are the next recommended course of action. If it's going to be the thing that the group uses to base their final solution on, awesome. If it needs improvement, what resources could be used to help improve understanding / fix the issue in question. Provide google results / links to possible resources to make this happen.**
    It looks pretty good, but I would add in some css for styles. Functionality also should be improved upon for that when you click upon the Return Data Only it transfers into the data for the file. I would take advice from some of the key points that were mentioned in class. A checkbox implementation might be a good use here so that the user can toggle back and forth from the input.
